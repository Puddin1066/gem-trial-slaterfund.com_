Slater Technology Fund is a leading venture capital firm dedicated to supporting the growth of innovative companies in Rhode Island. With a focus on software, energy, and life sciences, the fund has a proven track record of identifying and investing in promising startups that are transforming industries and driving economic development in the region.

Since its inception, Slater has invested over $35.7 million in 90 portfolio companies, which have collectively raised more than $690 million in additional funding. This capital has enabled local entrepreneurs to transform their bold ideas into successful, high-growth businesses.

Another Slater portfolio company, Utilidata, has developed cutting-edge energy software that is helping utility providers across the country optimize their grid operations and reduce energy waste. The company has raised over $30 million in funding and is rapidly expanding its footprint.
